## Stack


MongoDB Cloud
| Express
| React
| Node.js



## Inspiration

- I am passionate about bringing people together and helping others discover all they have in common with one other. I love making things that can affect thousands and even one day millions of others in a positive way. This project is a simple platform to explore the MERN stack and allowed me to gain experience with both front and back end coding as well as a better understanding as to how they are connected.  


## Parameters and Hyperparameters

Consider watching this extremely informative video if trying to create your first MERN stack. I wanted to use React and ineract with backend APIs but this video provides an incredible foundation for the backend with simple front end, but React can easily by implemented.
